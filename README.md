ðŸ›’ Grocery Item Detection (Custom Object Detection Model)
This project uses a custom-trained object detection model to detect grocery items like Parle-G, Crunchex, Balaji Aloo Sev, and more in real-time using a webcam or video. The model is trained on a custom dataset using YOLOv8 and achieves high accuracy on common retail products. Ideal for smart retail or automated billing systems.
